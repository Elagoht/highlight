# Markdown To HTML with Code Syntax Highlighting

This is a simple node.js project that converts an MD file to html. But with syntax highlighting some code places.

I already have developed with this feature with next.js application. This project is created to be an example for new developers.

And also includes copy code option and "Monokai" color scheme in CSS file.

To run the project

1. install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. then run the parser.js

```sh
node parser.js "content.md" "index.html"
```
